Topic: Profolio Analysis, Major Indices vs High Risk ETFs (Traditional/Crypto)

We will be investigating into 2 Large MarketCap ETF's and benchmark their performance against Nasdaq and SP500.

The choice of ETF's are ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), 9 Billion MCap, profolio focus is in high potential future looking technologies. Second ETF we will be investigating into is Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), 8 Billion Mcap, this is a crypto currencies only investment.

Both of the choosen ETFs are in the higher risk category, it will be very interesting to look at the calculated result between a traditional riskier profolio and a emerging crypto currency profolio compares and obviously summing up with the potential returns comparing to big indices like SP500 and Nasdaq.
